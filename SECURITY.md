# Security

Thanks for your interest in the security of one of Sweetwater's public or open source software projects. Please be aware of the following limitations regarding the security of our published projects at this time:

1. While our goal is to minimize the dependencies used by any project, there will often be software dependencies and some of those may have known vulnerabilities. We cannot, at present, commit to keeping those dependency references at the cutting-edge. These are _casual_ software projects published with no warranty or expectation of maintenance. Consumers are encouraged to fork the project and update the dependency references to suit their immediate needs.
2. Please report vulnerabilities in a project's own code through the project's "Report a Vulnerability" button on the Security page.
3. We do not operate a bug bounty program for these projects.
4. Please do not attempt to contact Sweetwater by other means (like well-known email addresses) outside of GitHub to report issues regarding projects published in this GitHub organization.
